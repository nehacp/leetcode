/*

Given a binary search tree in which each node contains an integer value (which might be positive 
or negative). Design an algorithm to count the number of paths that sum to a given value. The path
does not need to start or end at the root node or a leaf, but it might go downwards (travelling
only from parent nodes to child nodes)
